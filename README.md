# MERN Stack E-commerce Project
1. Technology Stack
MERN Stack:
MongoDB: NoSQL database to store product details, user data, and orders. Its scalability and schema flexibility make it ideal for dynamic applications.
Express.js: Middleware framework for handling server-side logic and API requests efficiently.
React.js: Frontend library for creating reusable components, enabling seamless and responsive user interfaces with efficient rendering via the virtual DOM.
Node.js: Server-side runtime environment to execute JavaScript and interact with databases.
2. Development Features
2.1 Backend (Node.js & Express.js):
Server Setup: Node.js server with Express.js to process HTTP requests and responses.
APIs: RESTful APIs for user authentication, product management, cart handling, and order processing ensure a seamless connection between the frontend and backend.
2.2 Frontend (React.js):
Project Structure: Scalable React.js setup for a clean and maintainable codebase.
UI Development: Responsive, user-friendly design with reusable components.
Routing: React Router for seamless navigation.
2.3 User Authentication:
Tech: Use Passport.js (session-based) or JWT (stateless) for secure login and registration.
Features: Route protection, middleware authentication, and input validation.
2.4 Product Management (MongoDB):
Database Design: Schema for product details (name, description, price, images, inventory).
Admin Controls: CRUD APIs for adding, editing, and deleting products.
2.5 Shopping Cart & Checkout:
Features: Add/update/remove items, order summary, shipping info, and third-party payment integration (Stripe/PayPal).
2.6 Third-Party Integrations:
APIs for payment gateways, shipping services, and geolocation to enhance usability.
2.7 State Management:
Implement state management via Redux or Context API for consistent user experience across shopping cart, user data, etc.
2.8 Testing:
Frontend testing with Jest and React Testing Library for reliability and maintainability.
3. Functional Requirements
User Authentication: Registration, login, and secure account access.
Product Catalog: Categorized, searchable products with detailed descriptions.
Shopping Cart: Add/remove items, order summary, and checkout with payment options.
Order Management: View history, track current orders; admin can process and update orders.
Reviews: Users can rate and review products.
Wishlist: Save products for later reference.
Inventory Management: Display stock status; notify users when products are unavailable.

Scalability: Support future growth in traffic and product catalog size.
Accessibility: Comply with WCAG standards for inclusive design.
Reliability: Ensure high uptime with backup and recovery mechanisms.
Compliance: Adhere to legal standards like GDPR.
Analytics: Integrate monitoring tools to analyze user behavior and optimize performance.
